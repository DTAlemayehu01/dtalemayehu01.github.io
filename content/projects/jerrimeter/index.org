In the 2025 T9-MediHacks me and a team of 4 others developed a password analyzer in 24 hours that measured the strength of an input string as a password, complete as a simple web-page that requires no hosting to run allowing any user to simply pick up and learn more about password security and information theory!

This placed first in the cybersecurity track of the competition netting our team Raspberry Pis 4B kits!
